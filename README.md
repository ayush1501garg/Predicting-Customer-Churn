# Predicting-Customer-Churn
This repository contains a Python project that focuses on predicting customer churn using machine learning techniques. We utilize popular libraries such as scikit-learn, numpy, and pandas to analyze a dataset containing information on 10,000 customers, aiming to develop an accurate churn prediction model through hyperparameter tuning.

## Introduction
Customer churn, also known as customer attrition, refers to the phenomenon of customers discontinuing their relationship with a business. Predicting customer churn is crucial for businesses to retain valuable customers and make informed decisions. This project focuses on building a machine learning model to predict customer churn using a dataset of 10,000 customer records.

## Installation
To set up and run the project locally, follow these steps:

### Clone the repository
### Create a virtual environment (optional but recommended)
### Install the required packages
### Run the project

## Data
The dataset contains information on 10,000 customers, including various features such as customer demographics, usage patterns, and engagement metrics. The goal is to predict whether a customer will churn or not based on these features.

## Methodology
Methodology
Data Loading: The dataset is loaded using the pandas library, allowing us to perform data manipulation and analysis.

Data Preprocessing: The data is cleaned, missing values are handled, and features are transformed as needed. Categorical variables are encoded, and numerical features are scaled.

Model Selection: We employ scikit-learn's library to train and evaluate multiple machine learning models, including but not limited to logistic regression, random forest, and support vector machines.

Hyperparameter Tuning: Hyperparameters of the chosen models are fine-tuned using scikit-learn's hyperparameter testing algorithms, such as GridSearchCV or RandomizedSearchCV.

Model Evaluation: The trained models are evaluated using appropriate metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score
